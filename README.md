# A viewer for art museum archives

Repcol is a pilot project by the company Bengler and the Section for digital collection management, with support from the Arts Council Norway. The aim of the project is to provide a fresh look at public art data and perhaps inspire museums in their daily digitisation work.

Repcol is a tiny app written in coffeescript. It only has a client side and is set up to transpile with brunch, so:

- On OS X – install node.js with brew
- Install brunch with npm 
- In project root
-- 'npm install'
-- 'brunch w -s'
